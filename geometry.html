      <h2>Introduction to Geometry</h2>
      <p>
        Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and the properties of space. It has wide applications in various fields such as
        architecture, art, and engineering.

      <h2>Geometric Shapes</h2>
      <p>
        In geometry, there are various shapes such as triangles, rectangles, circles, and polygons. Each shape has its unique properties and formulas that can be used to calculate its area, perimeter,
        and other properties.

      <h2>Angles</h2>
      <p>
        Angles are formed when two lines intersect. They can be classified as acute, obtuse, or right angles. The measurement of angles is expressed in degrees or radians. Angles have various
        applications in trigonometry, physics, and engineering.
