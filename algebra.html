      <h2>Introduction to Algebra</h2>
      <p>
        Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical operations and the manipulation of symbols. It involves solving equations, working with variables, and graphing equations. It is
        used in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.

      <h2>Basic Algebraic Operations</h2>
      <p>
        In algebra, there are several basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations can be performed on variables and constants to solve algebraic
        equations. One important concept in algebra is the order of operations, which specifies the order in which operations should be performed.

      <h2>Algebraic Equations</h2>
      <p>
        An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that states that two expressions are equal. It usually involves variables, constants, and algebraic operations. For example, an algebraic
        equation can be expressed as: x + 5 = 12 In this equation, x is the variable, 5 is a constant, and + and = are algebraic operations. Solving algebraic equations involves finding the values of
        the variables that make the equation true.
